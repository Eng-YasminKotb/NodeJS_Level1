`Express`: is a lightweight module that:
 - wraps the functionality of the NodeJS http modulr in a simple to use interface.
 - extends the fuctionality of the http module to make it easy for you to handle server routes, **responses**, **cookies**, and **statues of HTTP requests**.

  #### To install Express run the following command:
  ```javascript
 npm install express
```
once you have installed the express, you need to create an instance of the express class

```javascript
var express= require('express')
var app =express()
```
